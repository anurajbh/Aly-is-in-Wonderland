# Aly-is-in-Wonderland
"Aly is in Wonderland" is a VR project at Georgia Institute of Technology (in progress), for the Project Studio course. The project is in the Unity Engine, for the Samsung Odyssey. The basic premise of the project is this- The Queen of Hearts has lost her heart(a ruby), and is offering a reward for it. 

The project will incorporate the use of impossible space in order to simulate the feeling of vastness. 
Currently, a tech demo for the shrinking process has been implemented.

Note- This project was moved to Unity Collab, where it was completed.
