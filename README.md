# Aly-is-in-Wonderland
"What's up in Wonderland" is a VR project at Georgia Institute of Technology, for the Project Studio course. The project is in the Unity Engine, for the Samsung Odyssey. The basic premise of the project is this- The Queen of Hearts has lost her heart(a ruby), and is offering a reward for it. 

The project incorporated the use of impossible space in order to simulate the feeling of vastness. 

Note- This project was moved to Unity Collab, where it was completed. See http://etv.gatech.edu/2018/12/13/whats-up-in-wonderland/ for more details.
