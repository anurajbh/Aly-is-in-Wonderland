# Aly-is-in-Wonderland
"Aly is in Wonderland" is a VR project at Georgia Institute of Technology (in progress), for the Project Studio course. The project is in the Unity Engine, for the Samsung Odyssey. The basic premise of the project is this- The Queen of Hearts has lost her heart(a ruby), and is offering a reward for it. 
You will start off in a room in a castle. The ruby is in the room. Suddenly, a March Hare will come in and steal the ruby, taking it via a mouse-sized hole into Wonderland. Your goal is to follow him into Wonderland and take the ruby. 
You will see a key in the room, along with a note, saying "Shrink Me". If you touch the key, it will "shrink" you to the size of a mouse, and then you can follow the Hare into Wonderland through the hole. Once in Wonderland, you will be confronted by the sight of large mushrooms and a vibrant, lush forest.
After following the hare, you will arrive at the Tea Party, where the Hare will, unpredictable as he is, throw the ruby back at you, which you can catch, or pick up if you drop. The Queen of Hearts will then make an entry, and demand her "heart" back. Once you give it to her, her reward is to proclaim "Off with your Head!". The March Hare runs out, providing the cue for a chase sequence, where you have to escape. At the end of the route, you will find a key, with an inscription, "Grow Me". You have to grab the key, which will grow you back to your original size, and then you can escape through the door back into the castle.

The project will incorporate the use of impossible space in order to simulate the feeling of vastness. 
Currently, a tech demo for the shrinking process has been implemented.
